Long ago, in the jagged cliffs of the Forgotten Range, lived Dino, a fearless but clumsy climber.
To reach his best friend, who waits patiently at the summit, Dino must first gather the Quickdraws of Courage. Only when every quickdraw is in his pack will he have the strength — and safety — to ascend the final wall. Beware: the mountains are alive with peril, but friendship and persistence will guide Dino to the top!
